# Hardwire Dashcam

## Find the fuse box

Located under the steering wheel. You can open it by pulling, but then it will be very cramped. It's better to unscrew the two bottom bolts first and then pull it.

## Find a Switched fuse

TODO: Still have to do this step

Some fuses turn on and off with the engine, others stay always on. For a dashcam you want one that turns off with the engine to prevent draining your battery.

To find one, open the fusebox while your car is off and get a multitool. Find the fuses which satisfy the power requirement of your dashcam (my BlackVue battery asks for a 20A fuse), and check if they have power or not.

If they have power, you can already ignore them since they are constantly on.

If they don't have power, write their locations down, start your engine and retest.

## Route the power cable

TODO: Still have to do this step

A nice place for the batteries is hidden in the middle console near the end. This requires a cable to be routed from there towards the fusebox.

Still have to find how to open the panels to route it inside from the middle console, as opposed to going over the edge.

## Connect the fuse cable

TODO: Still have to do this step

Find the right fuse cable plug, unplug the fuse, plug it in the cable and plug the entire thing back in. Connect the power cable with the fuse cable.

Tidy up the cables with the supplied velcro strips and put them away nicely.

## Connect the ground cable

TODO: Still have to do this step

Find a nice bolt without paint, and attach the ground cable to it.

## Test everything

TODO: Still have to do this step

Set the battery in hardwire mode. Turn on the engine and check if the battery charges. Turn the engine off and check if it stops charging.

## Clean up

Close everything and congratulations!
