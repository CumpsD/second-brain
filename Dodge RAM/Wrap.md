# Wrap

## About

[3M Wrap Matrix Black](https://www.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/p/dc/v100832798/) done by [Ateljee Maes](https://www.ateljeemaes.be/nl)

The wrap material itself looks awesome, would recommend choosing the 3M Matrix Black.

I would however **not recommend the company** which has done it. They did not follow the curves of the car which ended up in a lot of torn wrap.

In comparison, my previous car got wrapped at [WAX-IT](https://wax-it.be/nl/) and had zero issues in over 5 years.

### First Damage (October 2020)

The wrap ripped at the trunk handle since the wrap did not follow the curves and was under tension over the handle.

Their solution was to remove it because *it would always give problems*.

### Second Damage (June 2021)

Holes start appearing at the front where the curve was not followed and the wrap is under tension. This would only get worse over time of course.

Mentioned this later in 2021 when I went back to them, got ignored and brushed of.

### Third Damage (August 2021)

Wrap starts tearing on the other side on the front as well, it was only a matter of time before a small piece of debris would pierce the part that did not follow the car.

### State Snapshot (June 2022)

The front is completely torn by now, exactly at the spots where they skipped the curves.

Some smaller details I noticed to keep an eye on, wouldn't be surprised if these tear over time as well.

Also saw this, no idea what they wrapped over there.

### State Snapshot (November 2022)

The front is probably all gone by now.
