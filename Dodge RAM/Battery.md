[Odyssey Extreme Series Battery PC1350](https://www.enersys.com/en-gb/products/batteries/odyssey/odyssey-extreme/)

> This PC1350 ODYSSEY 12v 95Ah Extreme Series Battery has phenomenal starting power and massive deep cycle reserve power in one battery!
>
> Designed and built to last up to 3 times as long. Thanks to rugged construction and TPPL (Thin Plate Pure Lead) design, ODYSSEY batteries have an 8-12 year design life and a 3-10 year service life.
>
> This non-spill Odyssey battery has a longer life than conventional batteries, providing up to 400 cycles to 80% depth of discharge.
>
> Welded intercell connections enable it to withstand extreme vibration, and AGM design holds acid in place to prevent spills, even when installed on its side. And unlike conventional batteries, ODYSSEY batteries can be stored for up to 2 years and still be returned to full power. (At 25°C. Storage times will be even longer at lower temperatures.)

> Odyssey Extreme Series Batteries
>
> Twice the overall power and three times the service life of conventional batteries \
> Some batteries offer enormous cranking power. Others, deep cycle reserve power. Unbeatable ODYSSEY Extreme Series batteries do both. Even at very low temperatures, ODYSSEY Extreme Series batteries have the power to provide engine-cranking pulses in excess of 2250 amps for 5 seconds – double to triple that of equally sized conventional batteries. And they can handle 400 charge-discharge cycles to 80% depth of discharge.
>
> How is so much power possible? \
> ODYSSEY Extreme Series batteries are made with flat plates made of 99.99% pure lead – not lead alloy, like many conventional batteries. Pure lead plates can be made thinner, so we can fit more of them in the battery. More ODYSSEY battery plates mean more plate surface area. And that means more power – twice as much as conventional batteries.
>
> Packed with more power \
> Like many popular spiral-wound batteries, ODYSSEY Extreme Series batteries employ dry cell Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) technology to contain acid, allowing the battery to be installed even on its side. But the densely packed flat plates in an ODYSSEY Extreme Series battery avoid the “dead space” between cylinders in a “six pack” design. The result is 15% more plate surface area — and that translates to more power!
