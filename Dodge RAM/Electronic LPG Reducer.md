# Electronic LPG Reducer

## About

[Prins eVP-500 LPG Reducer](https://www.prinsautogas.com/sites/default/files/media/members/sales-marketing/brochures/Flyer%20VSI-3%20DI.pdf)

> The fuel pressure is controlled by the Prins eVP-500, the world's first fully electronic LPG reducer for engines up to 500Hp ensuring correct LPG supply flow in all operating conditions, for smooth and optimal driveability performance.

## Why?

The stock LPG reducer of my RAM always turned off when accelerating too hard, even after dealership revisions. After talking to another dealer they suggested installing a digital reducer instead of the original membrane version. Since then there have been no more issues.
