# Carbon Wrap Console

For some reason, they have a gold/brown-ish inset. Nowhere else does this color come back. Others have vinyl carbon wrapped it.

## Removing Insets

* First, remove the knee bolster. These are held on with 4 clips and come off by gently pulling, starting from the bottom of the bolster:

* Remove the 7mm screw from the front of the trim piece. You may be able to get access to this without removing the upper center instrument panel (not sure) but I had mine out anyway:

* At the rear of the trim, insert a small, flat piece of plastic or metal to disengage the rear clip. I used a steel ruler but a small putty knife would work too:

* The back of the trim piece that shows the clip we are disengaging with the ruler:

* With the ruler still inserted, gently pry straight up, starting from the front of the trim piece. The gold trim, chrome bezel, and a piece of black trim will all come off as an assembly. It is held on with 4 clips:

* To separate the gold trim from the rest of the assembly, remove the 4 torx screws and disengage the clips:

* Disassembled and ready for the vinyl wrap:

* Once your pieces are wrapped, re-assemble everything by reversing the steps:
