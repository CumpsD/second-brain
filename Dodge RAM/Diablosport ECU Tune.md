# Diablosport ECU Tune

## Octane Numbers

The US and the rest of the world (EU including) use different octane numbers to indicate fuel.

> In Europe, the octane rating on the pump is simply the RON figure. America, by contrast, uses the average of the RON and the MON figures, called the AKI (anti-knock index). Thus, 97 octane “super unleaded” in Britain is roughly equivalent to 91 octane premium in the United States

The RAM uses 98 EU, so we can select a 93 US tune.
