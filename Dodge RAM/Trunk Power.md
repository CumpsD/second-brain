# Trunk Power

There is no outlet in the trunk. It would be easy to have an outlet here which turns on together with engine.

## Dealer Feedback

> We can add 12V from the towing point. About 1.5h of work, estimated price around 200 EUR.

## Components

I ordered some marine components to be sure of the waterproof aspect of it.
