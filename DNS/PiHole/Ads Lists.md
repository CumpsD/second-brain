# Ads Lists

## Blocklist

* [BlockList Project](https://blocklist.site/)
> This project lists a variety of lists for easy tailoring to user's blocking needs. These lists can be used in any combination and are definitively supported in Pi-Hole and AdGuard Home.
>
> Most users will want to check out the Advertising, Tracking, and Malware lists. Users looking for more protection could also look at the Phishing, Fraud, and Scam lists.
>
> Social Media focused lists, such as the Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok lists aim to block domains/hosts known to be associated with these social media platforms, regardless of purpose.

* [The Firebog](https://firebog.net/)
> Then, they're separated into green and blue. Green is the least likely for breakage, whereas blue lists are more likely to break things.
>
> I personally recommend using 1 to 2 blocklists from the Advertising, Tracking & Telemetry, and Malicious sections.
>
> You should avoid the crossed out lists. Feel free to experiment mixing the more aggressive "blue" lists with the less aggressive green ones.
>
> For many users, the categories and green/blue lists found here should cover what you need and/or want your PiHole to block.

## Whitelist

* [AnudeepND's curated whitelist](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist)
> The more blocklists you add, the more likely you'll come across a false positive. First, you'll want to check out Commonly Whitelisted Domains over at the Pi-hole forum, followed up by anudeepND's curated whitelist, and then you can see if anything below is relevant to your interests.
