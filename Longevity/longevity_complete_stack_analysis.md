## OPTIMIZED DAILY TIMING PROTOCOL

**Critical Note:** Vitamin C (100mg in ONE, 100mg in Collagen Booster) reduces sulforaphane bioavailability. This protocol separates SulforaPro from ONE by 30+ minutes.

| Time | Products | Instructions | Rationale |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **7:00 AM** | GlyNAC (2 caps) | Empty stomach | NAC absorption optimized fasted |
| **7:30 AM** | SulforaPro (2 caps) | Still empty stomach, before food | Separates from vitamin C by 30 min |
| | Spermidine PRO (1 cap) | Can take with water | Autophagy support; no food interaction |
| **8:00 AM** | ONE (1 sachet) | With fat-containing breakfast | Fat-soluble compounds need dietary fat |
| | Omega-3 (3 caps) | With breakfast | EPA/DHA absorption requires fat |
| | NMN 300mg (1 cap) | With breakfast | NAD+ precursor; morning timing optimal |
| **Midday** | Collagen Booster (1 serving) | Mix with any liquid | Flexible timing; protein synthesis |
| | Lithium Orotate (1-2ml) | With water | Ensure adequate hydration |
| **Evening** | Mg Bisglycinate (1-2 caps) | With dinner or 30 min before bed | Systemic Mg; relaxation; sleep support |
| | Mg L-Threonate (3 caps) | Before bed | Brain Mg; supports sleep overnight |

### Timing Notes

- **Morning clustering:** NAD+ boosters and Nrf2 activators are best taken in morning (energy-promoting)
- **Sulforaphane isolation:** Keep 30+ min away from vitamin C for maximum sulforaphane absorption
- **GlyNAC fasted:** NAC absorbs better on empty stomach; glycine is flexible
- **Spermidine flexible:** No specific food interactions; morning aligns with circadian autophagy
- **Evening Mg:** L-Threonate promotes sleep; avoid taking NAD+ boosters late (may increase alertness)

## CYCLING RECOMMENDATIONS

| Product | Protocol | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| ONE | Continuous daily | Foundation coverage |
| Collagen Booster | Continuous daily | Structural protein support |
| Mg L-Threonate | Continuous daily | Brain Mg levels need maintenance |
| Omega-3 | Continuous daily | Cell membrane incorporation is ongoing |
| GlyNAC | Continuous daily | Baylor RCTs showed benefits reversed after stopping |
| SulforaPro | Continuous daily | Hormetic effect; no tolerance development |
| NMN 300mg | Continuous daily | NAD+ requires sustained precursor supply |
| Mg Bisglycinate | Continuous daily | Systemic Mg levels need maintenance |
| Lithium Orotate | Continuous daily | Neuroprotection requires sustained low levels |
| Spermidine PRO | Continuous daily | Autophagy benefits require ongoing support |

**Intermittent protocols (if adding later):**

| 💧 **Lithium Hydration** | Micro-dose lithium requires adequate hydration | Drink 2+ liters water daily; ensure sodium intake |
| 🔥 **Niacin Flushing** | 20mg NE total (from ONE) | Mild flushing possible; take with food if sensitive |
| 💊 **SSRI Note** | NMN chosen over regeNAD to avoid L-tryptophan | regeNAD's 100mg tryptophan has theoretical serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs |
| 🥦 **Thyroid & Sulforaphane** | May increase T4→T3 conversion | Monitor if hypothyroid; may need medication adjustment |
| 💊 **Blood Thinners** | Multiple compounds have mild blood-thinning effects | Inform physician; monitor INR if on warfarin |
| 🌾 **Wheat Germ in Spermidine PRO** | Contains wheat germ extract | Avoid if celiac disease (though labeled gluten-free) |
| ☀️ **Vitamin D Ceiling** | 1000 IU in stack | If taking additional D3, monitor 25-OH levels (max 60 ng/mL) |
| 💛 **Yellow Urine** | Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) | Normal; excess riboflavin excreted — not a concern |

## REMAINING GAPS & FUTURE ADDITIONS

| Gap | Current Coverage | Potential Addition | Notes |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **CD38 Inhibition** | ●●●●○ (Luteolin 50mg + Quercetin 100mg) | Luteolin (additional 50mg) | Lost 45mg luteolin from regeNAD; ONE provides 50mg |
| **Senolytic** | ●●●○○ (Quercetin 100mg only) | Fisetin pulses | Consider quarterly high-dose protocol |
| **Mitochondrial ETC** | ●●●●○ | CoQ10 (100-200mg) | Especially if on statins |
| **AMPK Activation** | ●●●○○ | Berberine | Consider if metabolic concerns |
| **Methylation** | ●●●●○ | TMG (Betaine) | Can support NAD+ pathway |

## WHAT NOT TO ADD

| Product | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| regeNAD | Contains 100mg L-tryptophan — contraindicated with SSRIs (serotonin syndrome risk) |
| NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) | Redundant — NMN 300mg already provides direct NAD+ precursor |
| Standalone Resveratrol | Already in ONE (50mg) |
| Extra B-Complex | Already at 150-1200% RDI for B vitamins |
| High-dose Vitamin D | 1000 IU sufficient; risk of hypercalcemia |
| Taurine | June 2025 study contradicted earlier longevity claims |
| Methylene Blue | Too experimental for daily use |
