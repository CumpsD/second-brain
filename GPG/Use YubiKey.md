# Use YubiKey

# Configure Smartcard

Plug in a YubiKey and use GPG to configure it as a smartcard:

```console
$ gpg --card-edit

Reader ...........: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP U2F CCID
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010006055532110000
Application type .: OpenPGP
Version ..........: 3.4
Manufacturer .....: Yubico
Serial number ....: 05553211
Name of cardholder: [not set]
Language prefs ...: [not set]
Salutation .......:
URL of public key : [not set]
Login data .......: [not set]
Signature PIN ....: not forced
Key attributes ...: rsa2048 rsa2048 rsa2048
Max. PIN lengths .: 127 127 127
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
Signature counter : 0
KDF setting ......: off
Signature key ....: [none]
Encryption key....: [none]
Authentication key: [none]
General key info..: [none]
```

Enter administrative mode:

```console
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed
```

**Note** If the card is locked, see [Reset](#reset).

**Windows**

Use the [YubiKey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager) application (note, this is not the similarly named older YubiKey NEO Manager) to enable CCID functionality.

## Enable KDF

Key Derived Function (KDF) enables YubiKey to store the hash of PIN, preventing the PIN from being passed as plain text. Note that this requires a relatively new version of GnuPG to work, and may not be compatible with other GPG clients (notably mobile clients). These incompatible clients will be unable to use the YubiKey GPG functions as the PIN will always be rejected. If you are not sure you will only be using your YubiKey on supported platforms, it may be better to skip this step.

```console
gpg/card> kdf-setup
```

## Change PIN

The [GPG interface](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/) is separate from other modules on a Yubikey such as the [PIV interface](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/YubiKey_and_PIV.html). The GPG interface has its own *PIN*, *Admin PIN*, and *Reset Code* - these should be changed from default values!

Entering the user *PIN* incorrectly three times will cause the PIN to become blocked; it can be unblocked with either the *Admin PIN* or *Reset Code*.

Entering the *Admin PIN* or *Reset Code* incorrectly three times destroys all GPG data on the card. The Yubikey will have to be reconfigured.

Name       | Default Value | Use
-----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
PIN        | `123456`      | decrypt and authenticate (SSH)
Admin PIN  | `12345678`    | reset *PIN*, change *Reset Code*, add keys and owner information
Reset code | _**None**_      | reset *PIN* ([more information](https://forum.yubico.com/viewtopicd01c.html?p=9055#p9055))

Values are valid up to 127 ASCII characters and must be at least 6 (*PIN*) or 8 (*Admin PIN*, *Reset Code*) characters. See the GnuPG documentation on [Managing PINs](https://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch03s02.html) for details.

To update the GPG PINs on the Yubikey:

```console
gpg/card> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. D2760001240102010006055532110000 detected

1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN

```bash
$ ykman openpgp access set-retries 5 5 5 -f -a YOUR_ADMIN_PIN
```

# Transfer keys

**Important** Transferring keys to YubiKey using `keytocard` is a destructive, one-way operation only. Make sure you've made a backup before proceeding: `keytocard` converts the local, on-disk key into a stub, which means the on-disk copy is no longer usable to transfer to subsequent security key devices or mint additional keys.

Previous GPG versions required the `toggle` command before selecting keys. The currently selected key(s) are indicated with an `*`. When moving keys only one key should be selected at a time.

```console
$ gpg --edit-key $KEYID

Secret key is available.

# Multiple YubiKeys

To provision additional security keys, restore the master key backup and repeat the [Configure Smartcard](#configure-smartcard) procedure.

```console
$ mv -vi $GNUPGHOME $GNUPGHOME.1
renamed '/tmp.FLZC0xcM' -> '/tmp.FLZC0xcM.1'

$ cp -avi /mnt/encrypted-storage/tmp.XXX $GNUPGHOME
'/mnt/encrypted-storage/tmp.FLZC0xcM' -> '/tmp.FLZC0xcM'

$ cd $GNUPGHOME
```

## Switching between two or more Yubikeys

When you add a GPG key to a Yubikey using the *keytocard* command, GPG deletes the key from your keyring and adds a *stub* pointing to that exact Yubikey (the stub identifies the GPG KeyID and the Yubikey's serial number).

However, when you do this same operation for a second Yubikey, the stub in your keyring is overwritten by the *keytocard* operation and now the stub points to your second Yubikey. Adding more repeats this overwriting operation.

In other words, the stub will point ONLY to the LAST Yubikey written to.

When using GPG key operations with the GPG key you placed onto the Yubikeys, GPG will request a specific Yubikey asking that you insert a Yubikey with a given serial number (referenced by the stub). GPG will not recognise another Yubikey with a different serial number without manual intervention.

You can force GPG to scan the card and re-create the stubs to point to another Yubikey.

Having created two (or more Yubikeys) with the same GPG key (as described above) where the stubs are pointing to the second Yubikey:

Insert the first Yubikey (which has a different serial number) and run the following command:

```console
$  gpg-connect-agent "scd serialno" "learn --force" /bye
```
GPG will then scan your first Yubikey for GPG keys and recreate the stubs to point to the GPG keyID and Yubikey Serial number of this first Yubikey.

To return to using the second Yubikey just repeat (insert other Yubikey and re-run command).

Obviously this command is not easy to remember so it is recommended to either create a script or a shell alias to make this more user friendly.

## Switching YubiKey

gpg-connect-agent "scd serialno" "learn --force" /bye
