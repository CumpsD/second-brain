## Extra Info

### Certification

It used to be free to get your A1/A3 certification through the Irish MySRS but since the 1st of January 2021 they are charging money.

> “Your identity verification request will not be processed until after 31st January. It is expected that a charge of €5 will apply after 31st January for identity verification and €30 for UAS on line training, if you wish to cancel your application please logon and select “cancel” all of your personal details and documentation will be completely deleted from the MySRS system.”

The Belgian certification for A1/A3 and training course are still free. You can register yourself as an operator (insurance number required), follow the course and take your exam in an afternoon.

### Geo-Zones

Start with checking [Droneguide](https://map.droneguide.be/) to see if any zones are active where you want to fly. If there are, copy the zone code and paste it into [Geozones](https://es.mobilit.fgov.be/geozones/) to get more information. It is possible you can still fly in an active zone under certain conditions.
