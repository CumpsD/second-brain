> Help protect your hearing from harmful levels of noise, improve situational awareness and communicate clearly with team members in noisy environments, with 3M™ PELTOR™ ComTac™ XPI Headsets. They’re ideal for challenging environments where performance is critical, such as those seen by police or search and rescue teams. Our headsets protect against sound levels up to 28 dB. They can be worn comfortably with other protective equipment and have a level-dependent function to help you stay aware and alert to your surroundings. Two-way communication helps you coordinate with your team. Plug and play means they’re ready to work when you are, with no start up time. The fully-independent, dual-earphone system enables talk-through and can connect to an external radio signal. The electronics are completely contained inside the headset housing, so there’s no need for a separate control box, software loads or outside power source, giving you protection that’s safe from power fails. An earplug mode helps you maintain situational awareness when combined with earplugs, and the headsets save power by shutting down automatically when not in use. They’re available in green and black, and in a choice of foldable headband, neckband, and helmet-mounted models. Also available with a choice of microphones (including a bone conduction mic) for easy use in combination with gas masks and other protective masks. Tested according to the applicable parts of MIL-STD-810G, EMC-MIL-STD-461F.
