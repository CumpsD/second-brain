## FAQ

* Q: When do I use the Friction Guard XP Gun Oil instead of Shield XP Rust Preventative? \
  A: Friction Guard XP is recommended for use internally (rifle bores) to protect against rust and corrosion or as a lubricant on moving parts. The Shield XP is recommended for use on the exterior of firearms to protect against rust and corrosion and is not a lubricant. Please see our convenient and easy to use Lubricant/Preventative Selection Guide in the Specifications Tab or in the Knowledge Center.

* Q: Can I use Friction Guard XP inside my bore? \
  A: Yes, the Friction Guard XP can be used inside your bore to protect against rust and corrosion for extended periods.
