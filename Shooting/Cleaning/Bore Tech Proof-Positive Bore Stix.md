## Description

> The free-floating, dual bearing handle design allows for effortless motion and precise following of the barrel’s rifling. Translation: Proof-Positive Bore Stix provide effective cleaning and eliminate the frustrating issue of having jags and brushes unscrew from the end of the rod. In addition, the color-coded handles offer a comfortable, non-slip rubber grip that prevents damage to the rifle stock and eliminates the guesswork in determining what rod to use for what caliber.
>
> All Proof-Positive Bore Stix feature a replaceable, barrel safe, non-brass, Proof-Positive tip that eliminates the irritating false indication of copper fouling that is found with traditional brass tipped rods when using copper removing cleaners.
>
> The replaceable, female Proof-Positive tip also eliminates the need for additional adapters when changing between jags and brushes. Each Proof-Positive tip is specially machined to provide a completely smooth, edge-free transition between the rod and our Proof-Positive Jags. This removes all possibility of damage to the firearm’s crown while pulling the rod back through the bore.
>
> Utilizing a caliber specific, enhanced, high strength steel core, the Proof-Positive Bore Stix have unsurpassed rigidity that minimizes bow and flex. The steel core is coated with a proprietary, low friction coating that is extremely durable and chemically resistant providing years of dependable service.
