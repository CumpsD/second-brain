## FAQ

* Q: What is the difference between Eliminator, Cu+2 Copper Remover and [C4 Carbon Remover](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20C4%20Carbon%20Remover.md)? \
  A: The Eliminator removes both carbon and copper fouling and is recommended for most regular fouling situations. It provides a quick, easy and great overall clean. For extreme fouling situations the specific Cu+2 Copper Remover (Copper Removal Only) and C4 Carbon Remover (Carbon Removal Only) are recommended. These solutions directly target and effectively focus on removing their respective fouling types. Please see our [Chemical Selection Guide](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/raw/main/assets/shooting/boretech/Chemical-Selection-Guide.pdf) located in the Specification Tab or in our Knowledge Center for more information.

* Q: Is Eliminator safe to leave soak in a barrel overnight? \
