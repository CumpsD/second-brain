## Steps

* Use nylon brushes.

### Safety Check

* Point the rifle in a safe direction.
* Remove magazine.
* Pull the bolt back.
* Inspect the chamber, turn head and inspect again.
* Perform a control shot and put fire selector in safe.

### Cleaning the bolt and bolt carrier

* Remove the bolt carrier.
* Wipe down everything.
* Clean with [C4 Carbon Remover](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20C4%20Carbon%20Remover.md) and a brush.
* Pay attention to the extractor and ejector, use a cleaning pick if needed.
* Clean until [patches](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20X-Count%20Square%20Patches.md) remain clean.
* Remove existing oil with [degreaser](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Blast%20Degreaser.md).
* Put a [drop of oil](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Friction%20Guard%20XP%20Gun%20Oil.md) on the sides, bolt assembly and locking lugs.
* Wipe the oil in, use a [cotton swab](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Cotton%20Swabs.md) for difficult places.

### Cleaning the chamber

* Apply cleaner on a brush and clean out the chamber.
* Wipe the area and repeat until it comes out clean.

### Cleaning the barrel

> **Only push patches through the bore in ONE direction.**

* Inspect the bore for obstructions.
* Use a [bore guide](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Bolt%20Action%20Rimfire%20Bore%20Guide.md) to insert cleaning rod.
* Apply [Eliminator](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Eliminator%20Bore%20Cleaner.md) or [Rimfire Blend](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Rimfire%20Blend%20Bore%20Cleaner.md) to a patch and run a few wet [patches](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20X-Count%20Square%20Patches.md) through the bore.
* Remove the patches at the end of the bore and avoid scraping the crown.
* Let it soak for 5 minutes.
* Push dry patches through the bore until they come out clean.
* Repeat if needed.
* Apply a very thin layer of [oil](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Friction%20Guard%20XP%20Gun%20Oil.md) inside the bore and run after with a clean patch to remove any excess.

### Cleaning a carbon ring (optional)

* Insert a chamber plug.
* Use [C4 Carbon Remover](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20C4%20Carbon%20Remover.md) and let it soak for a while.
* Remove the C4 and wipe of with a chamber mop.
* Push dry patches through the bore until they come out clean.
* Repeat if needed.

### Function Check

* Insert bolt carrier and cycle to verify it moves smoothly.
* Pull trigger, it should fire on fire and not fire on safe.
* Insert magazine and verify it locks into place.
* Release magazine and verify it goes smoothly.

### Finishing Touches

* Apply some [oil](https://github.com/CumpsD/second-brain/blob/main/Shooting/Cleaning/Bore%20Tech%20Friction%20Guard%20XP%20Gun%20Oil.md) on a rag and gently go over exposed metal components.
