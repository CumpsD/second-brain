> The P320AXG PRO is the first full-sized pistol in the all-metal AXG family of P320 pistols. The signature look of the Pro-Cut Nitron slide matches seamlessly with the black anodized metal AXG Grip module. The modern features and modularity of the P320 platform combined with the performance and feel of a metal frame offers a truly special shooting experience.
>
> The black anodized AXG grip is complimented by Hogue G10 grip panels/rear insert and a detachable magwell for improved reloads.  The flat XSeries trigger ensures a clean break at 90 degrees for improved accuracy and trigger reset. The optic-ready Pro-cut slide is fitted with XRay3 day/night sights and compatible with Romeo1PRO, ROMEO2 and Deltapoint PRO optics for a direct-to-slide fit without the need for adaptor plates.  Each pistol comes standard with (2) 17rd steel mags fitted with Henning Group aluminum basepads.
